# credit-risk-classification
The objective of this analysis was to measure the performance of two logistic regression models in identifying creditworthy borrowers.
Model 1, trained on the original data, achieved an accuracy of 94.4% but and did pretty well with high-risk loans, but had room to improve.
Model 2, trained on resampled data, performed better with an accuracy of 99.6% and dramtically increased recall for high-risk loans (1.00).
Model 2 outperforms Model 1 in predicting high-risk loans and overall accuracy, making it the recommended choice for identifying credit risks.
